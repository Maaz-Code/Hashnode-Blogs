## Introducing Nexplore: a way to explore new recommendations.

Each one of us at some point feels the need to get more recommendations of songs or movies or even anime but you don't know which one to watch. So I have got you covered with my idea. My web app idea "Nexplore" is to build a recommendation website where people come to get a whole new list of recommendations of songs, movies, and anime. 

So you would want to watch movies which people have watched and a lot of them are recommending. Sometimes, you wanna watch anime that is worth your time, and from so many of them, it's confusing to choose too. Also, we often are unaware of underrated artists and their music, this could be a great way to discover them.

We all can just submit our recommendations on Nexplore for others to watch or listen to and also know what they are recommending. All you need is to submit a recommendation form and the details get submitted. I have also used the Clerk authentication system to authenticate users. Folks can sign up using custom details or with their Google account too. 

Checkout the codebase :  [Github](https://github.com/Maaz-Code/Nexplore) 

I haven't hosted the website yet due to the time barrier but will do that soon. 
I have used ReactJS, SCSS, and Clerk to build the web app. The Icons are from Bootstrap Icons.

Due to time constraints, I am writing the article in a hurry but I have decided to make the web app more useful and more robust, which I will do in the future. 
Attaching the screenshots below: 

1. Visit the website.

So this was my submission for the Clerk + Hashnode hackathon. It still needs work to be done and perfect hosting on Vercel (will post that later). Stay tuned for a future update on this article as I have more additions to do on this project.
