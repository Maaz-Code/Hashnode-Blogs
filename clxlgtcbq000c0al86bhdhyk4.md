In today's fast-paced software development environment, ensuring the quality and functionality of an application is critical. Automated testing has become an essential part of the development lifecycle, and tools like Cucumber have gained popularity for their ability to make testing more intuitive and collaborative. This blog will explore Cucumber testing and the Gherkin language, providing you with the insights and examples needed to understand and implement them effectively. This guide provides the gist of what I have used and practiced about Cucumber and Gherkin frequently.

## What is Cucumber?

Cucumber is an open-source testing tool that supports Behavior-Driven Development (BDD). It allows developers and testers to write test scenarios in plain English, bridging the gap between technical and non-technical team members. By using a human-readable format, Cucumber makes it easier for everyone involved to understand the requirements and functionality of the application.

### Key Features of Cucumber

1. **Plain Language Syntax**: Uses Gherkin, a plain language parser, making it accessible to all team members.
    
2. **Behavior-Driven Development**: Encourages collaboration between developers, QA, and PMs.
    
3. **Cross-Platform Support**: Compatible with multiple programming languages like Java, JavaScript, Ruby, and Python.
    
4. **Integration with CI/CD**: Easily integrates with Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines.
    
5. **Living Documentation**: Test scenarios written in Gherkin act as live documentation for the application.
    

## What is Gherkin?

Gherkin is the language used by Cucumber to define test cases. It is designed to be simple and readable, using a natural language format that encourages collaboration between developers and testers. Gherkin's syntax includes keywords like `Given`, `When`, `Then`, `And`, and `But` to structure the test scenarios.

## Writing Gherkin Scenarios

Gherkin scenarios are written in feature files with a `.feature` extension. Each feature file contains a description of a specific functionality or requirement, followed by one or more scenarios that describe different behaviors of that feature. All the steps are written here in these files which are later executed.

### Basic Structure of a Gherkin Feature File

A typical Gherkin feature file includes:

1. **Feature**: Describes the feature under test.
    
2. **Scenario**: Describes a specific situation or behavior to be tested.
    
3. **Steps**: Define the actions and expected outcomes using `Given`, `When`, `Then`, `And`, and `But`.
    

### Example Feature File

```bash
Feature: User login functionality

  Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
    Given the user is on the login page
    When the user enters a valid username and password
    And clicks the login button
    Then the user should be redirected to the dashboard

  Scenario: Unsuccessful login with invalid credentials
    Given the user is on the login page
    When the user enters an invalid username or password
    And clicks the login button
    Then an error message should be displayed
```

## Understanding Gherkin Keywords

* **Given**: Sets up the initial context or state of the system.
    
* **When**: Describes the action or event performed by the user.
    
* **Then**: Defines the expected outcome or result.
    
* **And** / **But**: Used to combine multiple steps in a more readable format.
    

### Example with Detailed Steps

```bash
Feature: Search functionality on e-commerce site

  Scenario: Search for a product by name
    Given the user is on the homepage
    When the user enters "laptop" in the search bar
    And clicks the search button
    Then the search results page should display products related to "laptop"
    And the search bar should retain the keyword "laptop"
```

## Implementing Gherkin Scenarios in Cucumber

To execute the Gherkin scenarios, we must implement the steps in a programming language like Java, JavaScript, Ruby, or Python. The step definitions map the Gherkin steps to the code that performs the actual test actions. These step definitions are chunks of code that act as functionality for our Cucumber steps.

## Benefits of Using Cucumber and Gherkin

1. **Enhanced Collaboration**: Cucumber fosters better collaboration among team members by using a common language that everyone understands.
    
2. **Improved Documentation**: The Gherkin scenarios serve as living documentation, providing clear and concise descriptions of the application's behavior.
    
3. **Increased Test Coverage**: Writing scenarios for different use cases ensures that various aspects of the application are tested.
    
4. **Automation**: Automated tests can be executed frequently, ensuring that the application remains robust and functional as it evolves.
    

## Conclusion

Cucumber is a powerful tool that simplifies writing and executing automated tests. Using a natural language format makes it easier for teams to collaborate and ensure the quality of their applications. This is being used in vast number of organizations and ecosystems on a wide scale level at a growing pace. Moreover, it has a large online community with extensive tutorials to make this very handy for everyone.

Personally me as a Software Engineer, I have been working with Cucumber for some time now and it has been a fun learning experience. I have written multiple test cases for multiple functionalities and extended documentation. All I can say it is a great beginner-friendly devtool that one should definitely try.
